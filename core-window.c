 *
 * Core per-window functionality.
 *
 * Provide a pane that is instantiated between the root and any window
 * stack, to provide common functionality.  These includes:
 *
 * - registering and forwarding per-window notifications
 * - Being an intermediary for per-window selections.
 *
 * ==============================================================
 * Allow any pane to "claim ownership" of "the selection", or to
 * "commit" the selection.  A pane can also "discard" the selection,
 * but that only works if the pane owns it.
 *
 * This can be used for mouse-based copy/paste and interaction with the
 * X11 "PRIMARY" clipboard.
 * When a selection is made in any pane it claims "the selection".
 * When a mouse-based paste request is made, the receiving pane can ask for
 * the selection to be "commited", and then access the most recent copy-buffer.
 * The owner of a selection will, if the selection is still valid, call
 * copy:save to save the selected content.
 * When a "paste" request is made where the location is based on the "point"
 * (current cursor) it is unlikely that a selection in the same pane should be
 * used - if there is one it is more likely to be intended to receive the paste.
 * So the target pane can first "discard" the selection, then "commit", then call
 * "copy:get".  If the selection is in this pane, the "discard" will succeed,
 * the "commit" will be a no-op, and the top copy buf will be used.
 * If the selection is in another pane (or another app via X11), the "discard"
 * will fail (wrong owner), the "commit" will succeed and copy the selection,
 * and the "copy:get" will get it.
 *
 * Operations are "selection:claim", "selection:commit" and "selection:discard".
 * When the selection is claimed, the old owner gets called (not notified)
 * "Notify:selection:claimed", and when a commit request is made,
 * "Notify:selection:commit" is sent.
 *
 * A client can declare itself to be a fall-back handler by calling
 * select:claim with num==1.  Then if any other client discards its selection,
 * the ownership reverse to the fallback.  The fallback typically provides
 * access to some selection external to edlib, such as the x11 selections.
