Welcome to 'edlib' (also 'elma') - a document editor that comes
in well defined pieces.

Many common emacs commands work mostly as expected.
So particular features include:

(:A is the Alt key prefix.  :C is control)
 :A-x nm    - enable reading of notmuch email
 :A-.       - perform 'grep' or 'git-grep' for word under cursor.
 :A-x autospell - enable spell checking.  right-click of menu of corrections.
 :A-x diff-mode - view a diff/patch usefully. Press :Enter to find
                  location in file.

In the document list (:C-x C-b) typing "H" will open in hex-view mode.
Typing "P" will only  ".md" file as a presentation.


Use C-x C-c to close - type 's' to save or '%' to not save in the pop-up
Mouse clicks move the cursor, and clicking on the scroll bar scrolls

Enjoy!
