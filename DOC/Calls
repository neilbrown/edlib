 This file list some the calls that are recognised by various panes.

# Misc

## view-changed

This is sent to a focus pane when a change happens that will affect
this particular view of a document.  This is often a change in highlights,
such as a selection.

If both mark and mark2 are given, the change reported is only between
the marks.  If neither mark is given, the entire view is suspect.
If only one mark is given, then the change is small and either starts
at 'mark' or ends at 'mark2'.  'num' gives the length in characters,
but if this length extends to another line, it may not be honoured.
