 This file list some the calls that are recognised by various panes.

# Misc

## view:changed

This is sent to a focus pane when a change happens that will affect
this particular view of a document.  This is often a change in highlights,
such as a selection.

If both mark and mark2 are given, the change reported is only between
the marks.  If neither mark is given, the entire view is suspect.
If only one mark is given, then the change is small and either starts
at 'mark' or ends at 'mark2'.  'num' gives the length in characters,
but if this length extends to another line, it may not be honoured.


# Documents

## doc:request:FOO

Request that when the document sends notification "FOO", it gets sent
to the provided focus.

## doc:notify:FOO

Request that the document sends notification FOO.

# Editor

## editor:request:FOO

Request to received notification for FOO send on the editor.

## editor:notify:FOO

Send notification "FOO" from the editor.

Known notifications include:

- all-displays.  This is sent to all displays.  The callback will
  contain a timestamp for the most recent event in 'num'.  The number
  of times the callback is called indicates how many displays there are.


# Window/input

## window:request:FOO

Ask to receive notification "FOO" send to current window.

## window:notify:FOO

Send notification "FOO" to current window.

Known notifications include:

- Keystroke-notify - string is the key name
- Mouse-event-notify - string is the event name

# Displays

A display pane provides linkage to keyboard/pointer input, and visual output.
It will generate Keystroke and Mouse-event events for its parent, and expect
various Draw: event from children.

## Draw:clear

Draw:clear will allocation a display image for the focus pane and clear it.
"str1" can be attributes for the background, typically a background colour
such as "bg:cyan". If no attributes are given and there is another pane
close to the root which has been cleared, the appropriate section of the
image for that pane is copied it the image for 'focus'.  If ther is no
image to copy from, the pane is cleared to "bg:white".

## Draw:text

This requests that text be drawn on the display.  If text already exists
at the same location it may be replaced or it may be blended.

- str1 is the text to draw.  Control characters should be avoided.
- (x,y) give the position for the top-left corner of the text
- str2 is attributes to apply to the text
- num, if non-negative, is a byte offset in str1 where a cursor should
  be placed.  The character following str1+num will be highlighted to
  indicate that presence of the cursor before it.  If num is the length
  of str1, then a cursor-on-space will appear after the drawn text.
- num2 is a scale to apply to the text.  1000 is the default (used if
  num2==0)  It is roughly "pixels per point * 1000"

## Draw:text-size

This request measures the size of 'str1'.  The result is returned using
comm2 as the (x,y) pair.

- str1 is the string to measure
- str2 is the attributes
- num, if non-negative, is a pixel offset to the right of the left edge
  The byte-position in the resulting image which would be drawn at the
  offset is reported
- num2 is a scale, as with Draw:text
- comm2 is called with the results of the measurement:
    - num is the byte offset corresponding to the requested pixel offset
    - num2 is the "ascent" for the text - pixel distance from baseline
      to top. This is typically used to determine where the "Top" left
      of the image should go when calling Draw:text
    - (x,y) is the width and height of the drawing of the text.
