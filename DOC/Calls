 This file list some the calls that are recognised by various panes.

# Misc

## view:changed

This is sent to a focus pane when a change happens that will affect
this particular view of a document.  This is often a change in highlights,
such as a selection.

If both mark and mark2 are given, the change reported is only between
the marks.  If neither mark is given, the entire view is suspect.
If only one mark is given, then the change is small and either starts
at 'mark' or ends at 'mark2'.  'num' gives the length in characters,
but if this length extends to another line, it may not be honoured.

# Editor

## editor:notify:FOO

  contain a timestamp for the most recent event in 'num'.  The number
  of times the callback is called indicates how many displays there are.

# Displays

A display pane provides linkage to keyboard/pointer input, and visual output.
It will generate Keystroke and Mouse-event events for its parent, and expect
various Draw: event from children.

## Draw:clear

Draw:clear will allocation a display image for the focus pane and clear it.
"str1" can be attributes for the background, typically a background colour
such as "bg:cyan". If no attributes are given and there is another pane
close to the root which has been cleared, the appropriate section of the
image for that pane is copied it the image for 'focus'.  If ther is no
image to copy from, the pane is cleared to "bg:white".
